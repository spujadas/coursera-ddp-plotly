# Coursera Developing Data Products Week 3 Peer-graded Assignment: Plotly

In this project, we created a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly, representing the number of road accidents in Great Britain from 2005 to 2015, grouped by severity (slight, serious, or fatal).

The presentation is [published online on GitHub Pages](http://spujadas.github.io/coursera-ddp-plotly/road-accidents-gb-2005-2015).

The source data sets are not included in this repository. To reproduce this presentation, you will need to download the zipped [All STATS19 data (accident, casualties and vehicle tables) for 2005 to 2014](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/road-accidents-safety-data/resource/8ecee6ac-33fd-4f5b-8973-e900cc65d24a) and [Road Safety - Accidents 2015](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/road-accidents-safety-data/resource/ceb00cff-443d-4d43-b17a-ee13437e9564) data sets, and then extract the `Accidents0514.csv` and `Accidents_2015.csv` files from these zip files in a subdirectory named `data`.
